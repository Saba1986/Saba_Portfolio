Subject: Intro to Web Development - CS 410/510 Final Project: Personal Website

Project Description: 
This website is the final project of Intro to Web Dev at Portland State University, and I used Visual studio code editor for my project. 
It is built by using HTML, CSS, bootstrap and JavaScript. 
The main feature of this website are navbar with a scrolling Effect, about section, previous work section using flexbox, projects section using flexbox and contact section. 
I designed a navbar on the left side of the page and put my image on top of that. I added a hover on each navbar button. 
Also, we can scroll the page up and down to move to the next section.
