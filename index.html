      <h1><span>Saba Izadkhah</span></h1>
      <p>
        I am a graduate student in Computer Science, and will be graduating Masters in August 2023. 
        I am also M.Sc. grad in computer engineering. 
        Through my coursework and professional experience, I've developed programming skills in Python, SQL, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        I have some experience in databases and the classes I am taking will help me to become an experienced Data scientist. 
        I also developed some skills in ML, AI and NLP which helped me to pursue my future career on those fields as well. 
        I am interested in an internship as a data scientist this summer to collaborate with my peers in the industry and increase my experience in tech companies.
        I love to spend time in the outdoors doing hiking and playing volleyball. 
        With the rest of my free time, I love to go shopping, cooking and movie nights!

          <h3>Stroke risk prediction</h3>
          <p>
            I created an AI project using Python last semester as the final project. 
            I had a dataset and each row in the data provided relevant information about a person, 
            for instance; age, gender, smoking status, occurrence of stroke, etc. 
            This dataset was used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various disease history, smoking status, etc. 
            A subset of the original train data was taken using the filtering method for Machine Learning and Data Visualization purposes. 
            I tested different AI algorithms to find the best result.

          <h3>Tuberculosis Prediction</h3>
          <p>
            Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycro-bacterium, which can affect all the organs along with the Lungs. 
            Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis has always been a problem. 
            Classification of medical data is an important task in the prediction of any disease. 
            In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to compare the performance of both K Nearest Neighbors and the ensemble of classifiers on Tuberculosis data.
            The classification models were trained using real data. 
            The results indicate that the ensemble Boosting Algorithm performs well among basic KNN, Local KNN, and Weighted KNN with an accuracy of 69.2%.
